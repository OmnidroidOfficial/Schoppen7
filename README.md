# Schoppen7

Yet another repository that illustrates a project that is not finished (yet). And even though "Achievements.cs", "Chat.cs" and "Instructions.cs" do exist in the Unity project but (gameplay is more fun when the instructions include explicit mention of next card that has been played and extensive analysis of options (consider it a strategy game), unfortunately I must focus on Python before I can continue with this (if Python data cannot be resolved by C#, it is no use optimizing the game for cross-platform hosting (from desktop to WebGL to AppleTV (unfortunately not (yet) gaming consoles (how easy is it to develop something for PlaystationsÂ¿)), online)) not yet in this repository, the computer syntax that has been typed here might be getting closer to true efficiency and maybe even something that may genuinely be referred to as "code"...
